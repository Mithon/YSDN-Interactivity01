                <p>Jeans are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trousers">trousers</a> often made from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denim">denim</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungaree_(fabric)">dungaree</a> cloth. Often the term "jeans" refers to a particular style of pants, called "blue jeans" and invented by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Davis_(inventor)">Jacob Davis</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss">Levi Strauss</a> in 1873. Starting in the 1950s, jeans, originally designed for cowboys and miners, became popular among <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenager">teenagers</a>, especially members of the greaser subculture. Historic brands include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi%27s">Levi's</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_(jeans)">Lee</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrangler_(jeans)">Wrangler</a>. Jeans come in various fits, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slim-fit_pants">skinny</a>, tapered, slim, straight, boot cut, narrow bottom, low waist, anti-fit, and flare. Owing to their high <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durability">durability</a> as compared to other common fabrics, "distressed" (visibly aged and worn, but still intact and functional) jean trousers have become increasingly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion">fashionable</a>, making pre-sale "factory distressing" a common feature in commercially-sold jeans.</p>

                <p>Jeans are now a very popular article of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casual">casual dress</a> around the world. They come in many styles and colors. However, blue jeans are particularly identified with American culture, especially the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_frontier">American Old West</a>.</p>
