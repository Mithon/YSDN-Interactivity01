                <p>I've gone through a lot of pairs of jeans in my life. Countless pairs of levis have been destroyed by either random sharp objects or fairly wonderful bike crashes. My first pair of raw denim jeans were the <a href="http://theunbrandedbrand.com/collections/skinny/products/ub101-skinny-fit-indigo-selvedge">Unbranded UB101 Skinny Indigo Selvedge</a>. They were thick and nice, but weren't the most comfortable and did not fit the greatest. They did however make me realize that raw denim was the way to go, it was tough and beautiful.</p> That is the last time I purchase jeans online. Do to this realization I went to <a href="http://www.dutildenim.com">Dutil Denim</a> on queen. By god those shelves will put a smile on the face of any jean lover. The shelves were filled to the brim with raw denim jeans ranging from less than a hundred dollars to more than five hundred. It was beautiful.

                <h2>Naked &amp; Famous</h2>

                <p>Let me preface this a bit. Before going I had already done my fair share of research, as I do with nearly every purchase. <a href="http://nakedandfamousdenim.com">Naked and Famous Denim</a> seemed to be some of the best bang for your buck raw denim. They were also based in Canada (Montreal) which made me feel a bit better about the purchase.</p>
                <p>So I walk in looking for one of two pairs, and they only have one of those types in my size. The <a href="http://www.dutildenim.com/collections/skinny-1/products/naked-famous-super-skinny-guy-stretch-selvage">Super Skinny Stretch Guy Stretch Selvedge</a> was the pair that I walked out with. It's stretch selvedge so it's pretty comfy and is more versitile. The jeans don't tear up my legs when I bike like my others ones which is nice. It'll be interesting to see how the fades look in a year or so. It's been a few months and they already have quite a bit of character. I'm already predicting a rip near the corner of where I put my phone.</p>
