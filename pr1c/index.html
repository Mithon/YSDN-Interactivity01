                <h2>Why?</h2>
                <p>Because I love coffee, that's why. Any more than that and you are just asking to get into an argument where I prove you wrong about what liquids are best for drinking. It is simply the best. What other drink can provide such a wide range of choice of tastes and cultures as well as fill you with copious amounts of caffeine.</p>

                <h2>How much?</h2>
                <p>If you mean how much do I love coffee I think you already know the answer to that question, so I'm going to assume you are asking about how much money coffee will cost you. Good news and bad news, Coffee equipment scales really well. By that I mean you can end up spending $50 or $10000, and thats just for equipment. So have fun and get ready for your wallet to empty.</p>

                <h2>Who?</h2>
                <p>One great aspect of coffee is the community around it, especially with the coming of "Third Wave coffee". The coffee community is huge, and is growing day by day. With startups selling it, and new people drinking it you can find coffee lovers everywhere. I assure you most of them are pretty cool, with only a pinch of stubborness.</p>

                <h2>Design?</h2>
                <p>While typing this I'm listening to an RGD webinar and Craigton Berman is currently talking. He is an industrial designer who got an incredible amount of press thanks to coffee. Including a design of a beautiful pourover coffee maker. From a chemex coffee brewer to a bodum coffee grinder, design is a large part of coffee.</p>

                <h2>Now.</h2>
                <p>Start drinking coffee. I'm pretty much telling you to do drugs. Yeah it's an addiction, but it's a <em>wonderful</em> addiction. Now is the time. Join the club. If I like you enough you can come over and I'll make you some coffee.</p>
