                <h2>Why?</h2>
                <p>Because I love coffee, that's why. Any more than that and you are just asking to get into an argument where I prove you wrong about what liquids are best for drinking. It is simply the best. What other drink can provide such a wide range of choice of tastes and cultures as well as fill you with copious amounts of caffeine.</p>

                <h2>How much?</h2>
                <p>If you mean how much do I love coffee I think you already know the answer to that question, so I'm going to assume you are asking about how much money coffee will cost you. Good news and bad news, Coffee equipment scales really well. By that I mean you can end up spending $50 or $10000, and thats just for equipment. So have fun and get ready for your wallet to empty.</p>
